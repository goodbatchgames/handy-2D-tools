How To use
==========

Core Package
------------

We have a core package free from any dependecy other than unity itself. It is both robust and light so you won't need to 
worry about it growing big on your project. The core is composed mainly by handy scripts. 

The core package can be downloaded at the :ref:`downloads page <download-latest-page>` for you to import it as an asset package.
You can also use the unity's package manager's git importing approach as you can see below:

|

Any scripting that requires other packages (i.e. the Input System or Cinemachine) will be treated as an add-on and will be available in the add-ons section 
of our :ref:`download page <download-latest-page>`. You can separately import add ons as assets based on your projects needs.
