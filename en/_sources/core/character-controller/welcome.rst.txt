Character Controller
====================

We have actions and character controller separate because you may have stuff in your game that
perform actions but you do not consider it to be a character. A game manager for example can benefit
from our actions components but won't need to be controlled on the screen.

With that in mind here we have the bundle of components that are destined to... err... 
control characters.
